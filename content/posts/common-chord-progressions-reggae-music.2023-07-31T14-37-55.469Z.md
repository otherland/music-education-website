Dominant seventh chords add tension and can be used creatively to emphasize certain parts within a song.

## Style and Sound
**Style and Sound**

Reggae music is known for its distinct style and sound, which sets it apart from other genres. The combination of rhythmic guitar strumming, deep basslines, skanking rhythms, and powerful vocals creates a unique musical experience that captures the essence of reggae.

One key aspect of reggae's style is its laid-back tempo. The slow yet infectious rhythm gives reggae its signature relaxed vibe. This allows listeners to feel the music deeply and connect with its message on a profound level. Reggae artists often emphasize the downbeat, creating a steady groove that gets people moving and swaying to the music.

Another defining characteristic of reggae is its use of off-beat accents. Known as "skanking," this technique involves emphasizing beats two and four rather than the typical one and three found in many other genres. Skanking adds an unexpected syncopation that brings energy to the music while maintaining a steady flow.

The sound of reggae is heavily influenced by Jamaican culture and history. It reflects the struggles faced by marginalized communities in Jamaica while also celebrating their resilience and determination. Lyrics often touch upon social justice issues, love, spirituality, or simply spreading positive vibes.

The guitar plays a crucial role in shaping both the style and sound of reggae music. Guitarists typically use **palm muting** techniques combined with upstrokes to create percussive sounds similar to those made by drums or percussion instruments like bongos or congas. This contributes to the rhythmic foundation of every tune.

Additionally, **chord stabs**, where chords are played abruptly on each beat instead of being sustained throughout, add further texture to reggae songs' overall sound. These short bursts give rise to sharp accents that punctuate melodies effectively.

To enhance authenticity in playing reggae guitar chords, it's essential for players not only master chord shapes but also develop effective strumming patterns. Understanding the right combination of downstrokes, upstrokes, and accents is crucial to achieving that authentic reggae sound.

Artists like Bob Marley and SOJA have contributed significantly to shaping the style and sound of reggae music. Their timeless hits such as "No Woman No Cry" by Bob Marley or "I Don't Want To Wait" by SOJA exemplify the distinct characteristics of reggae, showcasing its infectious rhythm, powerful vocals, and socially conscious lyrics.

In conclusion, understanding the style and sound of reggae music is essential for anyone looking to play or appreciate this genre. The laid-back tempo, off-beat accents, percussive guitar techniques like palm muting and chord stabs all contribute to creating a unique musical experience. By studying iconic artists' work in reggae music such as Bob Marley or SOJA, we can gain valuable insights into how these elements come together seamlessly to define this beloved genre's signature style.

## What Is Choking or Chopping?
What Is Choking or Chopping?

In reggae music, "choking" or "chopping" refers to a specific technique used by guitarists and other instrumentalists to create rhythmic accents. It involves muting the strings with your fretting hand while strumming or picking, resulting in a staccato sound. This technique adds a unique flavor to reggae music and is an essential part of its distinctive rhythm.

Choking or chopping creates short bursts of sound that give reggae its characteristic choppy feel. By muting the strings, you can control the duration and intensity of each note, creating a percussive effect that complements the rhythm section of the band. When executed correctly, it adds depth and texture to the overall sound.

To achieve this technique, place your fretting hand lightly on top of the strings near the bridge while still maintaining contact with them. This allows you to dampen or mute their vibration when strumming or picking. Remember not to press too hard; a light touch is all that's needed for effective choking.

Let's take a look at an example: In Bob Marley's iconic song "No Woman No Cry," listen carefully to how he uses choking during certain parts of the song. The muted chords create rhythmic emphasis, giving it that unmistakable reggae vibe.

Choking can be incorporated into various chord progressions in reggae music and is often combined with other techniques like palm-muting for added versatility. Experimenting with different placements on the string length between bridge and nut will produce varying degrees of muffled sounds—**close**r **to** th**e b**ridge resultin**g i**

So next time you're jamming along to some classic reggae tunes on your guitar, try incorporating choking into your playing style! It may take some practice at first but mastering this technique will help you capture those authentic reggae rhythms and bring the infectious energy of reggae music to life.

Remember, choking or chopping is just one aspect of the rich tapestry that makes up reggae music. By understanding these techniques and incorporating them into your playing, you can unlock the essence of this genre and truly appreciate its distinct style and sound.

**Note**: It's worth noting that choking or chopping isn't exclusive to guitarists—it can also be used by other instrumentalists such as keyboard players or even percussionists using muted drum hits. The technique adds a layer of complexity and intricacy to the overall arrangement, contributing to reggae's unique musical identity.

## Reggae Strumming Style
Reggae Strumming Style

When it comes to reggae music, one of the most distinctive and integral elements is the strumming style. Reggae strumming is characterized by its laid-back groove, syncopated rhythms, and emphasis on off-beat accents. This unique strumming technique sets reggae apart from other genres and gives it that unmistakable sound.

In reggae music, the guitar acts as a rhythmic instrument rather than just a melodic one. The strumming pattern typically focuses on playing chords in a steady rhythm with strong emphasis on the upbeats or "off-beats." This emphasizes beats two and four of each measure instead of the usual downbeat emphasis found in many other styles of music.

To achieve this distinct strumming style, **it's important to relax your hand and wrist** while maintaining a consistent rhythm. It's all about finding that balance between relaxed control and maintaining steady timing. Keep in mind that **reggae music is meant to be felt as much as it is heard**, so try to tap into the laid-back groove when you play.

A classic reggae strumming pattern often involves using muted strokes or "chops" on the off-beats while letting certain notes ring out on the upbeats. This creates a percussive effect that adds depth to the overall sound. Try incorporating these chops along with varied dynamics (playing softer for verses and louder for choruses) to enhance your reggae playing.

Let's take Bob Marley's iconic song "No Woman No Cry" as an example: 

```
Verse:
G       C       G       Em
No woman no cry
G       C       G       D

Chorus:
C           D      G     Em
Everything gonna be alright
C             D      G    D 
Everything gonna be alright

Bridge:
Em   Bm7  Am7
Said I remember when we used to sit
```

In this song, you can hear the reggae strumming style in action. Pay attention to the relaxed rhythm and off-beat accents throughout the song. **Experiment with incorporating muted strokes on the off-beats** to achieve that classic reggae sound.

Remember, mastering reggae strumming style takes practice and patience. It's all about finding your own groove within the music while staying true to the laid-back essence of reggae. So grab your guitar, find some reggae tracks to play along with, and let yourself get carried away by the infectious rhythms of this genre.

Keep exploring different songs from various artists such as Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, or Jimmy Cliff to further develop your understanding of reggae strumming style. Enjoy immersing yourself in this vibrant musical tradition!
